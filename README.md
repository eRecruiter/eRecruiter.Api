eRecruiter.Api
==============

Libraries to make communicating with the eRecruiter API a lot easier.
Contains classes for all entities that are sent to/from the API, as well as helpers to parse the requests/responses.

**These libraries are NOT REQUIRED to use the eRecruiter API**, because it is based on simple REST and JSON or XML, but these libraries get you started a lot faster if you are using .NET to work with the eRecruiter API.
